                <p>
                    Other than coding I enjoy many activities that allow me to use my creativity and drive for knowledge.

                <p>
                    I enjoy writing and game design, and I am in the process of creating some simple games in my free time. 
                    Additionally I collect and play board games, I currently own around fifty diffferent games and expansions.
                </p>

                    I  also enjoy cooking and learning new recipes, I have a particular fondness for Italian and Asian food. 
                    When I have the time to get outdoors, I love to go camping and hiking with my friends.
