# portfolio

Hello! This is my repository to host my portfolio made using react.js. While learning react I made a couple of small react projects that I integrated into this 
website to prove my proficiency in some key react skills. Through creating these projects I learned about state, conditional rendering, API calls, forms, and design. 
I hope this project shows my ability to create react apps. Thanks!
